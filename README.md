# Sections Pro Remix OSS

I recently upgraded my legacy Shopify app to the new Remix template. During this process, I realized it would be helpful to have a real-world example of a production app to see how another developer approaches Shopify app development. That led me to the idea of open-sourcing the Shopify-specific parts of my project while keeping the sections and blocks I actually sell proprietary. This project is the result of that idea.

### A few caveats

- As of Nov 2024, this app isn’t in production. I plan to launch after the holiday season to avoid disrupting current customers. I have it running on a Digital Ocean server and tested it so it is production ready.
- The app doesn’t include the sections or blocks that come with the original app, and I don’t intend to make those open source.
- This app isn’t meant to be built or run—there are no build instructions, as it’s just an example.
- I'm not an expert in React or Remix, and this is my first Remix app, so please consider that when reviewing the code.
- I am open to feedback and improvements but this is not a priority.
